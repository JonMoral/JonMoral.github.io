<!--===============Process================-->
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item-text">
    <h4 class="light" style= "color: #d9c186"> DESIGN PILLARS</h4>
    <p>I wanted to create a game about my family's experiences and reimagine what my life would be like if I was an immigrant living in the U.S trying to support my family back home.<br></p>
    <p>I defined three design goals: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The game will primarily use my family's stories of migration and have limited influence from other people's stories as to not misrepresent their history. I am allowed to use magical realism.</li>

        <li>The game will frame the process of migration as a very human and honest but arduous process.</li>

        <li>At the core, the narrative will be about a father and his daughter and how migration affects their relationship.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class= "sub-section">
      <ol>
        <li class="unbold"><strong>Planning:</strong><br>
          I created a design document in Google Drive breaking down my design pillars and the different mechanics and sytems I would need to create my vision. I also drafted a simple <a class="page" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDA_framework"><b>MDA</b></a> document breaking down what I want the player to feel when playing the game. I began concepting art style and decided for simple pixel art to limit the scope of the project and avoid any "uncanny valley" effects.</li>

        <li class="unbold"><strong>First Digital Prototype:</strong><br>
                I began testing the narrative beats inside Inform 7 and how to tell the story. If the game was centered around narrative I needed a way to test what worked and what didn't. I also began solidifying the art style separately.</li>

        <li class="unbold"><strong >Second Digital Prototype:</strong><br>
                I began implementing the narrative into a space the player could interact with using Unity. I designed and implemented systems for dialogue, object interaction, audio, and inventory management.</li>

          <li class="unbold"><strong>Adaptive Terrain Footsteps: </strong> This system allowed us to to change footsteps in real-time using a raycast shot from the foot downwards that would collect information on the terrain's texture.

    <h4 class="light" style= "color: #d9c186">SOLIDIFYING ART PIPELINE</h4> 
    When our team was beginning to define the game's art style we refrenced our design pillars to explore our options and found two main inspirations:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Hand-carved wooden figures</li>
        <li>Alebrijes paint patterns</li>
      </ul>
    Both had strong connections to mesoamerica and most of our team had grown up with these figures therefore we had a lot of reference material to work with.
    <br>
    <br>

    <strong style="color:#d9c186">Process:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li class="unbold">We created a 3D art mood board that was focused on defining the general shape of models</li>

        <li class="unbold">We created a Texturing mood board focused on the painted design patterns on alebrijes.</li>

        <li class="unbold">We created low-poly models to accentuate the rigidness of faces similar to carved figures.</li>

        <li class="unbold">We decided to paint textures directly on to models instead of UV unwraping to reflect the painting process by alebrije makers.</li>
      </ol>

        <ul>
          <li class="unbold">Strictly using low poly models without extra vertices around joints and adequate weight painting resulted in <strong><em>jarring artifacts in animations</em></strong> as seen on <em>Fox Walking Animation</em> (The fourth image from the left)</li>
          <li class="unbold">The art team was exporting models with <strong><em>no set standard</em></strong>.</li>
          <li class="unbold">After sculpting there was no process for <strong><em>retopologizing</em></strong> models to get them ready to implement in engine.</li>
          <li class="unbold"><strong><em>Painting textures</em></strong> created a bottleneck in our art pipeline and resulted in low turn around time for assets.</li>
          <li class="unbold"><strong><em>Weight Painting</em></strong> was only being done by one person.</li>

          <ul>
            <li class="unbold">I worked with the art team and <strong><em>assisted in creating models</em></strong> with extra vertex loops around the joints where we would require extra mobility when animating.</li>
            <li class="unbold">I worked with our lead artist to <strong><em>set up a standard startup file</em></strong> for the modeling programs that had every required setting as the default and a rectangular prism as a refrence for the player character's scale.</li>
            <li class="unbold">I assisted in <strong><em>retopologizing</em></strong> of assets until we had some of our artists with shorter tasks begin to retopologize.</li>
            <li class="unbold">I worked with our texture artist to <strong><em>mirror texture detail on models</em></strong> this doubled speed and still gave the illusion of the Alebrije painting. On top of that we were still able to add non-symmetrical elements to add variance across models.</li>
            <li class="unbold">I setup a <strong><em>rigging</em></strong> and <strong><em>weight painting pipeline</em></strong> that taught artists how to do it at its simplest level and scale it to more complex models.</li>
